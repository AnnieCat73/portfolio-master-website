## Overview

This is my web development portfolio website.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
-Navigate between sections and/or pages.
- Send email via the form in the contact section.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

- Planning – What will the site look like, which color scheme and images to include as well as deciding which content to include.
- Drawing mockups of components and sitemap.
- Which responsive layout pattern serves each section best, CSS Grid or Flexbox?
- Are there any reusable components or classes we can use?
- Mobile-first approach. I used CSS resets and CSS variables, then set global styles, utility classes, typography, and layouts for each section.
- Javascript added for the mobile menu in header section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS resets
- CSS custom properties
- Utility classes and reusable components
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript for menu

### What I learned

This was another great practice in doing a project from scratch. I designed and coded the site all by myself and by doing that I am feeling more confident in my web development skill set.

### Continued development

I will continue to update the site as needed. I will add any new information about myself and any work or projects when this is available.
